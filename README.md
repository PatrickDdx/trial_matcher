# Clinical Trial Matcher AI Agent  

![Trial Matcher Workflow](./trial_matcher_example.png)

## Overview  
This repository contains a **Clinical Trial Matcher AI Agent** that intelligently extracts key patient details from free-text descriptions and matches them to relevant clinical trials using the [ClinicalTrials.gov API](https://clinicaltrials.gov/).  

Designed for oncologists, researchers, and healthcare professionals, this solution uses **LLM-based reasoning** to:  
- Parse unstructured patient descriptions into structured data (condition, intervention, age, gender, location).  
- Search clinical trial databases using Boolean logic for precise filtering.  
- **Rank trials** based on patient eligibility and relevance, providing a short explanation for each match.  

This project includes a Streamlit UI and a **notebook** (`.ipynb`) for easy experimentation.

## ‚ú® Features  
‚úÖ **Automated Key Fact Extraction** ‚Äì Converts messy patient descriptions into structured, machine-readable data.  
‚úÖ **Smart Trial Search** ‚Äì Queries ClinicalTrials.gov with Boolean operators for precise filtering.  
‚úÖ **Relevance Ranking** ‚Äì Ranks trials based on clinical appropriateness, with short justifications.  
‚úÖ **Customizable Agents** ‚Äì Easily swap or fine-tune LLMs for improved domain-specific performance.  
‚úÖ **End-to-End Pipeline** ‚Äì From input text ‚Üí trial search ‚Üí ranked output, all in one flow.

## üìä Example Workflow  

**Input:**  
> *"I have a 55-year-old female with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. She has progressed after first-line carboplatin/paclitaxel and immunotherapy with pembrolizumab. Looking for trials with novel antibody-drug conjugates or PARP inhibitors, preferably in the US."*

**AI Output:**  
```
Rank: 1
nctId: NCT04837209
Title: Radiation, Immunotherapy and PARP Inhibitor in Triple Negative Breast Cancer
Status: RECRUITING
Locations: Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Duke University Medical Center
Reason: This trial is specifically focused on metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and includes patients who have progressed after immunotherapy, making it a strong fit for the patient. It also includes a PARP inhibitor (Niraparib) which the patient is seeking.

Rank: 2
nctId: NCT05933265
Title: Study of LP-184 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
Status: RECRUITING
Reason: While this trial addresses advanced solid tumors including TNBC, it does not mention PARP inhibitors or ADCs, but the patient‚Äôs eligibility still fits.

## üöÄ Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.10+  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- OpenAI API Key (or any LLM provider you configure)  
- ClinicalTrials.gov API access (free)  

### Installation  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PatrickDdx/trial_matcher.git
cd trial_matcher
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage  
Run the included notebook:  
```bash
jupyter notebook trial_matcher.ipynb
```

Modify the `message_desc` variable to test different patient descriptions.

## ü§ù Potential Use Cases  
- **Oncology clinics** ‚Äì quickly surface trial options for patients who have exhausted standard therapies.  
- **CROs / Biotech companies** ‚Äì identify eligible participants for recruitment.  
- **Medical researchers** ‚Äì explore trial landscapes for specific conditions.
